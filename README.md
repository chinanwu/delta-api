# Delta-API

## What?
This is the backend API server for the Delta word game. 

## How do I use this?
- `git clone` this repo!
- Then, use terminal to navigate to this folder (make sure it's in your GOPATH), and run `go run main.go`
- If you want to run the tests, simply run `go test` in the same location! 

I suggest you also grab a copy of Delta-UI, which is what will be hitting this.
